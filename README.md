This project visualizes relationships between various board games, showcasing an interactive network graph that highlights connections based on shared characteristics. Using D3.js, I mapped node positions, defined visual styling, and implemented interactive behaviors like dragging and node-pinning. The design incorporates scalable elements such as node size and color intensity, representing node connectivity clearly.
